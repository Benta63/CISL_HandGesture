# CISL_HandGesture
As part of an undergraduate research project with the Cognitive Immersive Systems Laboratory, I created (hopefully) a hand gesture recognition software

## Notes on Data

* Need to Split data into training/testing/validation
  * Training can be:
    * All inside data with gloves
    * Do a count. Maybe all with sleeves as well
  * Validation can be:
    * All inside without gloves
  * The results we will look at is:
    * All Outside data applied to NN

* Need to classify how well the algorithm does on certain types of images, e.g. Sleeves/No sleeves, no gloves vs gloves. Perhaps do some type of statistical tests??
